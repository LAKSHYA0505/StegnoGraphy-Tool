# SecureCover: Advanced Steganography Tool 🔒🖼️

This project is part of my **AICTE IBM Cyber Security Internship**.

---

## 🔍 Project Description

**SecureCover** is an advanced steganography tool that allows embedding any file (text, PDF, image, etc.) inside image files using Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.

### Key Features:

- Embed secret text or any file into cover images (BMP, PNG).
- Extract embedded secret data from stego images.
- Custom header to reliably identify message size and file extension during extraction.
- Seamless handling of both text-based and binary files.

> ⚠ **Disclaimer:**  
> This project is for educational and learning purposes only. Not intended for illegal use.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL)
- Struct (for binary data handling)
- OS module (for file operations)

---

## 🚀 Current Features

- ✅ Text embedding into images.
- ✅ File embedding (PDF, image, any file type).
- ✅ File extraction with extension detection.
- ✅ Custom binary header structure.
- ✅ Error handling for image size, file formats, and corrupted data.
- ✅ Works on Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu).

## 📦 Installation Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
cd YOUR-REPO-NAME

2️⃣ Install Dependencies

pip install pillow

🎯 Usage

Run the tool:

python steganography_tool.py

Follow on-screen prompts:
Embed Mode:

    Enter path of cover image.

    Enter secret text or select a file to hide.

    Enter output file name for stego image.

Extract Mode:

    Enter path of stego image.

    Extracted data will be printed (for text) or saved (for files).

🖼️ Example Flow

1️⃣ Start program → Choose embed
2️⃣ Provide image → Provide secret data (text or file) → Get stego image saved.

3️⃣ Later run → Choose extract
4️⃣ Provide stego image → Extracted secret file or message appears.
📈 Project Status

    ✅ Core embedding & extraction fully functional.

    🔜 AES encryption module (coming soon).

    🔜 Steganalysis (coming soon).

    🔜 Audio file support (coming soon).

    🔜 GUI interface (coming soon).

📚 Learning Outcome

    Learned advanced steganography algorithms.

    Worked with binary data encoding.

    File I/O handling.

    Built robust error-handling logic.

    Applied cybersecurity concepts practically.
